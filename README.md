With the use of AJAX we will download only content we want to user to see at a time.

Requirements:
1.	On page load have AJAX make a call to get page 1 contents to display it.
2.	If the user clicks on the button or scrolls down the end of the page auto load the next content with the use of AJAX.
3.	Make sure you keep track of where you are 1-4 and events must use the event listener function.
